# CMMM
ceiling mounted moving microphone

This Arduino based project controls one set of microphone (in my case one ORTF set) to move it around just like a spider cam.

- using https://github.com/Jomelo/LCDMenuLib for display control
- using http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper/index.html for motor control

# Version 0.5
First version tested and found as usable
